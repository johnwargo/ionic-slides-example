# Ionic Slides Example

When I first used Ionic Slides (https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/slides) I couldn't find any complete examples I could use as a starting point for my application. Josh Morony's [Creating Ionic Applications with StencilJS](https://www.joshmorony.com/creating-ionic-applications-with-stencil-js/) book introduced me to the topic, but didn't give me the playground I needed to tweak the slides example to better understand how to get text and images to work on the same slide, how to scale slide images to fit the screen, and more.

With that in mind, I decided to craft my own example nd make it available for others interested in learning how to add slides to their Ionic applications.
